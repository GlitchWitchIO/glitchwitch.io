## Third Party Services

The following third party services may be used by glitchwitch.io and as such you may be bound to those privacy policies as well.

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy), [Formspree](https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/), [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy), and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/)

## Voluntarily Submitted Information

glitchwitch.io may retain information you voluntarily submit. It is up to you whether to submit information and how much information to provide. Information submitted to glitchwitch.io, including but not limited to comments, emails, and other communications may be disclosed publicly at anytime without prior warning or royalty.

## Tracking and Analytics

This website relies on CloudFlare for very basic DNS based traffic analytics. Emails sent from glitchwitch.io may include tracking pixels because emails give me anxiety. Email open/click tracking can usually be blocked with third party software if you wish to opt-out of this.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

The current vulnerability disclosure policy adopted by glitchwitch.io can be found on the [reports page](/reports).

## Privacy Policy Changes

This policy may change at anytime without prior warning. Changes can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/GlitchWitch/glitchwitch.io/commits/master/_pages/privacy.md)
