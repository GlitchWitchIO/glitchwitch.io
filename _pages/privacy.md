## Third Party Services

The following third party services may be used by glitchwitch.io and as such you may be bound to those privacy policies as well.

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy), [Formspree](http://docs.formspree.io/files/privacy.pdf), [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/), [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy), and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/)

## Voluntarily Submitted Information

glitchwitch.io may retain information you voluntarily submit. It is up to you whether to submit information and how much information to provide. Information submitted to glitchwitch.io, including but not limited to comments, emails, and other communications may be disclosed publicly at anytime without prior warning or royalty.

## Tracking and Analytics

This website relies on CloudFlare for very basic DNS based traffic analytics. Emails sent from glitchwitch.io may include tracking pixels because emails give me anxiety. Email open/click tracking can usually be blocked with third party software if you wish to opt-out of this.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated or agreed upon in written communication, a 45-day disclosure deadline will apply to all bugs and vulnerabilities found by glitchwitch.io research. All findings will be disclosed to the public once either a patch has been made broadly available or after 45 days from the initial report, regardless of the existence or availability of patches or workarounds. Extenuating circumstances, such as active exploitation, threats of an especially serious (or trivial) nature, or situations that require changes to an established standard may result in earlier or later disclosure.

## Privacy Policy Changes

This policy may change at anytime without prior warning. Changes can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/GlitchWitchIO/glitchwitch.io/commits/master/pages/privacy.md)
