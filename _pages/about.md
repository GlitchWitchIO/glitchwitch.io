## Who is GlitchWitch? <span style="font-weight:300; font-size:40%;"> They/Them </span>

GlitchWitch is an Independent Security Researcher, Penetration Tester, and Bug Hunter who spends most of their free time learning how things work and improving what they can along the way.

For over a decade they have worked independently with a wide variety of companies on an expansive list of technical projects.
Some of their past clients include Internet Service Providers, VoIP Providers, Web Hosting Providers, Retail Chains, Government and Multimedia Organizations.

Currently, they work as a freelance consultant and are [available for new engagements](/services/).

## What is this website?

This website is an archive of things they've learned, discovered, and want to share. This might take the form of CTF write-ups or working with new vulnerabilities and tools.

This site will also feature information about [vulnerabilities and bugs they've found](/reports/) and reported to third-party vendors as well as [services they provide](/services/).

## What is your real name?

GlitchWitch is a pseudonym used to preserve privacy (much like an author may have a pen name). GlitchWitch should be stylized as either 'GlitchWitch' or 'GlitchWitch.io' in all public references such as blog posts, bug credits, and snarky commentary.

If a legal requirement arises that requires private disclosure of a legal name — such as a bug bounty payout or service contract — this will be shared in confidence.
