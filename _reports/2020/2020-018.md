## Summary
Due to the lack of rate limiting or captcha on a specific end-point it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to send a large number of SMS text messages to a phone number of their choosing.

This allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to abuse the service and perform "SMS Flooding", resulting in the target receiving hundreds or thousands of SMS text messages per minute.

## Proof of Concept
First we must craft a request to the vulnerable end-point. The request body is as follows.

```http
GET /api/v1/sendLink/6474951311 HTTP/1.1
Host: mycard.vistaprint.com
User-Agent: Hacker 7.23
Connection: close
```
In this case we used a free phone number provided by our friends at [TextNow](/blog/2018-02/textnow-security-update) as our target for testing.

Once we have crafted this request, we can use Burp intruder to repeat the request a desired number of times. To do this we can append `?req=§0§` to the `GET` request and create a payload list of a numerical sequence of 100.

We can note that the first response was received at `08:29:12 GMT` and the last response was received at `08:29:22 GMT`. Since 100 requests were sent we can determine that messages can be sent at a minimum rate of 10 messages per second, or 600 per minute from a single attack.

As shown in the following screenshot 100+ sms messages were received by the target.

## Active Exploitation

At 2:57 AM on 25 Feburary, Twitter user `@scottbix` posted [a video of his phone being flooded with messages](https://twitter.com/scottbix/status/1232137526061752322) from various platforms, including but not limited to Zoom. Based on this example we can determine with a high degree of certainty that this vulnerability is actively being exploited for malicious purposes.

## Recommended Actions
 - Implement captcha and other rate limiting controls to prevent abuse.
 - Discontinue unused end-points
 - Implement a security and bug reporting information such as a [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) file so security researchers can more easily report findings in the future.
 - Perform a full penetration test of the web platform and API to identify further issues.
