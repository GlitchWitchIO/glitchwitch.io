## Summary
An IP address appearing to be managed by "Urban Compass, Inc." and running "Apache Airflow" is accessible to remote unauthenticated users causing sensitive information disclosure and potentially allowing for denial of service and service interruption.

## Proof of Concept
The IP address in question is `3.91.40.185:8080`. Simply opening the affected target in a web browser reveals sensitive information such as the slack token shown at `/admin/variable/`. Additionally no authentication is required to make modifications within Apache Airflow.
Please see the attached screenshots for further proof.
