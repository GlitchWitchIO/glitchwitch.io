## Summary
An IP address appearing to be managed by "Volly" [formally SoftVu/LoyaltyExpress](https://mortgageorb.com/loyaltyexpress-rebrands-as-volly) and running "Apache Airflow" is accessible to remote unauthenticated users causing sensitive information disclosure and potentially allowing for denial of service and service interruption.


>[Volly is described as](https://www.linkedin.com/company/myvolly/about/) "the mortgage and banking industries'â€‹ most innovative component-based platform that seamlessly integrates marketing and customer engagement strategies with robust lending technologies."

## Proof of Concept
The IP address in question is `18.216.123.147:8080`. Simply opening the affected target in a web browser reveals sensitive information such as the slack token shown at `/admin/variable/`. Additionally no authentication is required to make modifications within Apache Airflow.

Viewing the affected target reveals several pieces of sensitive data, including but not limited to the following slack token `xoxb-116199269811-LPKzljDYdXJIpD175PdQmFOO`.

Using the [`auth.test`](https://api.slack.com/methods/auth.test/test) slack api function we can determine the token is for `softvu.slack.com` as shown at `https://slack.com/api/auth.test?token=xoxb-116199269811-LPKzljDYdXJIpD175PdQmFOO&pretty=1`.

Visiting `softvu.slack.com` reveals to two domains, `@softvu.com`  and `@loyaltyexpress.com`, both of which now redirect to `myvolly.com`.

Additionally using the [`users.list`](https://api.slack.com/methods/user.list/test) slack api function reveals 119 email addresses all ending with either `@myvolly.com`, `@softvu.com`,  or `@loyaltyexpress.com`.

With the above information extracted from the exposed slack token we can confidently asses that the asset likely belongs to Volly. While additional authentication tokens were exposed on several different pages, include DAG code, only the slack token's validity was verified.

_It is also important to note that in addition to sensitive information disclosure it is also possible to make modifications and perform actions as an administrative user on the Apache Airflow instance. This could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or additional sensitive information exposure._

## Recommended Actions
 - Implement proper access controls.
 - Revoke exposed credentials and tokens.
 - Review access logs for all exposed services and credentials to ensure no unauthorized access has been detected.

## Remediation Status
According to uptime robot the slack token was revoked as of `2020-08-19 21:50:05`. Additionally the exposed airflow interface was taken down as of `2020-05-16 20:47:49`.
