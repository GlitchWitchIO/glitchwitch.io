## What is this website?

This website is an archive of things I've learned, discovered, and want to share. This might take the form of CTF write-ups or working with new vulnerabilities and tools.

This site will also feature information about [vulnerabilities and bugs I have found](/reports/) and reported to third-party vendors.

Currently, I am available for hire as a Penetration Tester with a focus on Black Box Security Testing. I have extensive experience with both web and application security testing. I typically can employ a variety of testing methods based on your needs.

I can provide security assessments using a combination of automated vulnerability assessment tools and manual testing following the Open Web Application Security Project [(OWASP) Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project), [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide) and my own set of independently formed methodologies.
