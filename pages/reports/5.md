## Summary
An amazon S3 bucket containing both released and unreleased promotional material, marketing information and media source assets (PSDs, Ai etc) is publicly readable.


## Proof of Concept
By visiting `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bmi.tmobile/` or running the following command `aws s3 ls s3://bmi.tmobile --no-sign-request` a remote unauthenticated user is capable of receiving a list of objects stored in this bucket. It appears all objects stored on this server can also be directly downloaded.

## Recommended Actions

 - Disable directory listing for unauthenticated users

## Remediation Status

At the time of publishing this report the reported issue has been resolved.

Attempting to run `aws s3 ls s3://bmi.tmobile --no-sign-request` now results in
`An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListObjects operation: Access Denied`
