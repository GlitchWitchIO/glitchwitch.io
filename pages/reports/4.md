## Summary
On 17 July 2018 Australia's National Health Practitioner Ombudsman and Privacy Commissioner was [reported to be misconfigured](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/government-left-red-faced-by-health-privacy-commissioner-s-website-bungle-20180717-p4zs1t.html). Shortly after the article was published the initial issue had been resolved. Upon furher investigation it was found that two backup files displayed in the previous directory listing were still publicly accessible.

## Proof of concept

`119-82-150-91nhpopcgovdev-1461043056-complete-2016-04-26-16-31-54.zip` and `database-119-82-150-91nhpopcgovdev-1461043056.sql` on the root of the website were still publicly accessible to anyone with the direct link to these files.

Inside these insecurely stored backup files a few things were found including but not limited too...

 - The website administrators password
 - The MySQL Database Name, Username and Password
 - All Settings, Posts and Content that is normally not accessible to the public / non-admin users
 - Improper use of the Wordpress Authentication Unique Keys and Salts configuration
 - Previous IP address of the website administrator

## Recommended Actions

The following remediation actions were recommended...

 - Backup files referenced earlier should be immediately deleted
 - Admin password should be changed
 - MYSQL password should be changed
 - If not already implemented Authentication Unique Keys and Salts should be randomized and changed
