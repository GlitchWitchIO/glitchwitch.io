## Summary
On 9 July 2018 I notified caamanitoba.com of a Remote Code Execution vulnerability caused by CVE-2018-7600 aka Drupalgeddon 2. At the time I also indicated that I had evidence that this vulnerability had likely already been exploited by a malicious party.

## Evidence of Previous Compromise
This issue was originally discovered due to a sudden increase of CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) [phishing emails using a previously unseen template](https://gist.github.com/GlitchWitchIO/12ed258ca6a85b3629a756005c5178a1). Later it was confirmed that all recipients of this phishing campaign had also been caamanitoba.com customers.


In on instance, a unique email address that had been used during signup to caamanitoba.com on 06 June 2018 had received the aforementioned phishing email. The email in question – a unique email forwarder – consisted of 24 character string (similar to `███-███████-june-06-2018@redactedcatchall.tld`) and had not been provided to any other service. Since then this forwarder has not seen any other emails, spam or otherwise.


At the time of writing this, none of those same users had reported fraudulent transactions on credit cards they had provided to caamanitoba.com, however it is still possible that attackers could have stolen that information.
