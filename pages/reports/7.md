## Summary

By sending a `DELETE` request to a specific API location it is possible to arbitrarily delete Shaw Go Wifi device profiles from any account.

This attack requires some authentication. For the request to be successful an `access_token` needs to be generated either from an IP associated with any Shaw customer or by remotely logging into a @shaw.ca email. The `access_token` can be used to delete device profiles even if they are associated with another account.

## Proof of Concept

We can generate `access_token` by visiting `https://wifi-registration.shaw.ca/drp/` and inspecting the response from `/api/token`.

After generating an `access_token` we can send a `delete` request, replacing `c15c0d06f00d` with the device ID. The device ID is usually either the device MAC Address or `120100██████` with `██████` being a sequentially generated hexadecimal value.

Request:
```http
DELETE /api/customer/devices/c15c0d06f00d HTTP/1.1
Host: wifi-registration.shaw.ca
Connection: close
Authorization: Bearer [access_token_redacted]
